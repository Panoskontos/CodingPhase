Additional head meta content is the description when googling

You usually use span tags if you want to style things

You can check website performance from Network->No throtling 

rel="no follow" means this has nothing to do with link

See what data you are sending Network->All->see what you submited

">" in css means that you target only what you specify with no inheritance

* { } usually we use this when we want to set some default

Each browser does things different you want to remove that
You should go to meyerweb.com and grab the css code to create a new reset.css code
load the reset.css to your index

To have responsive width in each device you should use 100vw

Arial, Helvetica, sans serif i want this to be arial if it does not exist go helvetica
else go sans serif

Think of this like clockwise
padding: top right bottom left; 

display: inline-block;
the box takes the whole space but with inline block it takes what is specified */

Having an element taking all of the space when inspecting it means that no matter what nothing will
ever get next to it. That's why we use display:inline-block;

If you want to remove an element you can use display none

position boxes precisely 
position absolute is going to be static on scroll  
while fixed will come with scroll (menus) 
position: fixed; position:absolute;

combo with absolute!!!!
position: relative;
means make other boxes with position absolute position inside you

z-index decides if boxes are behind or above each other

the css variables on root will make your css achitecture so much better
but on't use them for everything only for the things that are going to be
REUSED (backgrounds, buttons, sizes, radiuses)
